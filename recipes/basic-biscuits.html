        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. 
                Also, the protein in flour (when combined with 
                moisture and heat) creates gluten, which provides structure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavened in this 
                easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, 
                giving the biscuits volume and texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt:</strong> Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it 
                strengthens the protein in the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Shortening:</strong> Shortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter 
                which contains water and milk solids. This means it's 
                better at reducing (or "shortening!") gluten strands, 
                resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Dough</strong>: Sift the dry ingredients 
                into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. 
                Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Knead and Roll</strong>: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured 
                surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even 
                sheet that's about Â½-inch thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cut and Bake</strong>: Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut 
                out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased 
                baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting 
                process, until all the dough is gone. Bake until golden brown.
