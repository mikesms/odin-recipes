    <h1>Mascarpone Mashed Potatoes</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Here's a make-ahead mashed potato recipe featuring 
        creamy mascarpone cheese. Make them in advance, then 
        simply bake until the tops are a beautiful golden brown. 
        "Not only is this a delicious alternative to regular mashed 
        potato recipes, but it's a very user-friendly way to serve 
        your potato side dish," says Chef John. 
        "They're really decadent: not too rich, but just rich enough, 
        and perfect for any special occasion."
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>½ cup mascarpone cheese at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place potato halves into a large pot of salted water, 
            bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. 
            Cook until very tender, about 15 minutes. 
            A knife should pierce the middle of a potato half easily. 
            Transfer potatoes to a colander and drain thoroughly, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Whisk mascarpone cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. 
            Stir egg yolk and milk into mascarpone cheese, 
            until smooth; season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer potatoes to a separate large mixing bowl, 
            add butter chunks to potatoes, and season with salt 
            and black pepper. Mash butter into potatoes with a 
            potato masher until fluffy; a few lumps are okay. 
            Whisk mascarpone mixture into mashed potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>Spread mashed potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Smooth the top and use the tip of a spatula to lightly 
            press the potatoes and lift up to create little peaks 
            and valleys in the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are heated through and 
            top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
