        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, 
            whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, 
            a party appetizer, a game-day nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre.
            Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar 
            cheese team up for savory, cheesy flavor that can't be beat. 
            These are so yummy! My family makes every Christmas morning.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sausage: </strong>This sausage balls recipe starts with 
                a pound of ground pork sausage. 
                Use hot ground sausage for a spicy kick.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Baking mix:</strong> Use a store-bought mix, 
                such as Bisquick, or make your own at home with pantry staples.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheese:</strong> These sausage balls wouldn't be complete 
                without shredded Cheddar.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the sausage and baking mix together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the mixture into balls. Transfer to a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until the balls are golden brown and the sausage is cooked through.
